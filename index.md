# Privacy Policy for Tanzimak (تنظيمك)

**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025

Thank you for choosing Tanzimak ("we," "us," "our"). This application is designed to help university students organize their class schedules. Your privacy is simple to explain because our app is simple.

**Tanzimak collects no personal data.**

Tanzimak is a 100% offline application. It does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information.

- We do not ask for your name, email, phone number, or any other personal identifier.

- We do not use any analytics, trackers, or advertising SDKs.
- We do not access your device's location, contacts, or other personal information.

## 2. Data You Provide

You may enter data into the app, such as course names, codes, and timings. This information is:

- Stored only on your own device
- Never transmitted to us or any third party
- Deleted if you uninstall the application
- This data is not considered "personal data" as it is not linked to you or any identifier

## 3. Data Subject Rights

Since we do not collect or hold any of your personal data, the concepts of data access, correction, or deletion (Data Subject Rights) do not apply. The data you enter exists only on your device, and you have full control to modify or delete it at any time from within the app.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

If we update our app in the future to include online features (like cloud backup), we will update this policy accordingly and notify users through the app store listing and in-app notifications.
